# End of Development Indefinetely
Flame.JS on Discord is no longer being maintained as of 26 January 2022. This is due to the forced change to slash commands broguht down to us by Discord themselves. Nertivia's Flame will continue to be developed for an indefinite amount of time, and Flame may return at a later date.
